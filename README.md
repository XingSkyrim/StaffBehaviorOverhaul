A Project of Rewrite Skyrim Havok Behavior for magic part Behavior 
Using Havok Content Tools , Notepad++ ,Skyrim Behavior Tool to write it

Mainly separate Staffâ€™s behavior diagram from the behavior of the two-hand magic
to facilitate external expansion and improvement


Improve some behaviors by using Bethesda's improved Blend Node
Separate motion data by using Istate node

Use timer modifier mode and a other large number of modifier nodes such like EEM expressions to implement counters
To calculate the number of times the state machine is entered under specific conditions

Added additional large state machines to design new behaviors

Fixed some premature clipping clip node issues
